# 3. Print one of following messages (substituting the letter for x):
#      - The letter x is a vowel
#      - The letter x is a consonant
# Hints:  Use the in operator to check if a character is in another string
#         For example, if some_char in 'abc':



# exercise-02 Length of Phrase

# 1. Prompts the user to enter a phrase:
#      Please enter a word or phrase:

# exercise-03 Calculate Dog Years

# Write the code that:
# 1. Prompts the user to enter a dog's age in human years like this:

# 2. Calculates the equivalent dog years, where:
#      - The first two years count as 10 years each
#      - Any remaining years count as 7 years each
# 3. Prints the answer in the following format:
#      The dog's age in dog years is xx
# Hint:  Use the int() function to convert the string returned from input() into an integer


# exercise-04 What kind of Triangle?

# Write the code that:
# 1. Prompts the user to enter the three lengths of a triangle (one at a time):
#      Enter the lengths of three side of a triangle:
#      a:
#      b:
#      c:
# 2. Write the code that determines if the triangle is:
#      equalateral - all three sides are equal in length
#      scalene - all three sides are unequal in length
#      isosceles - two sides are the same length
# 3. Print a message such as:
#      - A triangle with sides of <a>, <b> & <c> is a <type of triangle> triangle



# exercise-05 Fibonacci sequence for first 50 terms

# Write the code that:
# 1. Calculates and prints the first 50 terms of the fibonacci sequence.
# 2. Print each term and number as follows:
#      term: 0 / number: 0
#      term: 1 / number: 1
#      term: 2 / number: 1
#      term: 3 / number: 2
#      term: 4 / number: 3
#      term: 5 / number: 5
#      etc.
# Hint: The next number is found by adding the two numbers before it



# exercise-06 What's the  Season?

# Write the code that:
# 1. Prompts the user to enter the month (as three characters):
#      Enter the month of the season (Jan - Dec):
# 2. Then promptshtt the user to enter the day of the month:
#      Enter the day of the month:
# 3. Calculate what season it is based upon this chart:
#      Dec 21 - Mar 19: Winter
#      Mar 20 - Jun 20: Spring
#      Jun 21 - Sep 21: Summer
#      Sep 22 - Dec 20: Fall
# 4. Print the result as follows:
#      <Mmm> <dd> is in <season>

# Hints:
# Consider using the in operator to check if a string is in a particular list/tuple like this:
# if input_month in ('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar'):
# After setting the likely season, you can use another if...elif...else statement to "adjust" if
# the day number falls within a certain range.
